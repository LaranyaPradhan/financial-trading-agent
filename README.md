# Financial Trading Agent

## Overview
This project builds a financial trading agent that compresses market data and historical patterns to enable faster decision-making with reduced API costs.

## Problem
Trading systems rely on large volumes of historical data and frequent API calls, increasing processing time and cost.

## Solution
We compress historical market data using feature extraction and pattern summarization techniques before feeding it into a decision model.

## Features
- Market data compression
- Historical pattern summarization
- Fast decision-making engine
- Reduced API calls
- Cost-efficient processing

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (optional)

## How It Works
1. Fetch market data
